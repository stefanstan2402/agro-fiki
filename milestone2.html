                <p class="security__description">
                  We identified the problem through a team colleague. He had noticed that there are a lot of people who want to buy 
                  products from local producers, but don't have the opportunity to meet or get to know such people. Also, a few of us 
                  knew local producers who would have products to sell from their own production, but do not know how to advertise and 
                  sell them. We thought that an app could be a solution to this problem, as it could create a conducive environment for 
                  buyers and sellers to fulfill their needs.

                <p class="app__description">
                  As in any application selling goods, there are two types of users: buyers and sellers. At the of buyers, 
                  we talked to friends, work colleagues, relatives, close friends. We observed their needs and preferences, 
                  the fact that most of them stick to supermarket products either out of convenience or lack of access to traditional 
                  products. In terms sellers, we used the OLX platform. There we contacted different sellers, some of them gave us a 
                  nice answer, others not. The problems identified here were slow promotion to customers, and the fact that for ads to 
                  be popular, you have to invest money in monthly promotion. Transportation to buyers is also a problem for the seller

              <p class="app__description">
                Through these interviews we had with different people, we realized that they need a safe place to communicate 
                with each other. Buyers are looking for affordable quality products that have not been chemically processed and 
                sellers are looking for a place where their work is appreciated. We realized that both sides want an app that is 
                as user-friendly and easy to use as possible, where things are clear and unambiguous.

            <p class="app__description">
              We believe we are ready to move into the Customer Validation phase, as we want to have a clear vision of our 
              product and how it can best interact with future customers. In this phase we want to test assumptions and 
              hypotheses about the customer problem, the target market and the product itself by creating anonymous 
              questionnaires. At the same time, given the number of responses to the interviews we have conducted, we 
              have gathered some valuable ideas about what is wanted from a product like a marketplace app for organic 
              and locally produced products.
