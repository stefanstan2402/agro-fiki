                <p class="security__description">Agro aims to target farmers in particular. Whatever the size of
                    their business, Agro is an innovative startup that
                    will make it easier for them to sell directly to their customers. The app doesn't aim to cater
                    exclusively to one age, gender
                    or religion, but will be centered mainly on people in rural areas, where production is higher
                    than in urban areas.
                    In terms of customers, the app will focus on urban users, those who don't have access to natural
                    products
                    and buy mainly from supermarkets, but want quality products

                    Its role is to deliver warehouse products directly
                    to the customer's home, thus bringing them their shopping list. However, these products don't
                    necessarily come from small retailers
                    local retailers and do not guarantee that they are the freshest products stocked in the
                    warehouse.</p>
