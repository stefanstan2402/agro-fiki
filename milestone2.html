        <p class="security__description">
          During the brainstorming session necessary to come up with an idea of a startup, all of us realized that, 
          especially on the consumer side, there is a great demand of farmers products in the ranks of people living 
          in the town without access to them.<br><br>
          <b>Firstly</b>, consumers might say that they can get these products at the supermarket or the local farmer market, 
          but these products usually come at a really high price and their origin cannot be validated, thus providing 
          a psychological barrier to the consumer.<br><br>
          <b>Secondly</b>, on the farmers side, there were some cases where producer interest was validated:<br><br>
          - <b>Local producers</b> in the countryside having a great orchard, and producing more than they could ever eat, but 
          not having a space to sell their harvest in order to maximize profits.<br>
          - <b>Producers who do not have an open market</b> and are forced to sell their products to middle men in order to make 
          some money.<br>
          - <b>Farmers</b> who do not have enough visibility and think they will never be successful.<br><br>
          Thus, by taking into account these memos obtained from real cases during our brainstorming we found the problem 
          we want to solve.

        <p class="app__description">
          Our plan of customer discovery was to identify where we could find the persons that fit into one of the 
          two parties: <b>consumers or producers</b>.<br><br>
          - <b>For consumers</b> we planned to ask friends, work colleagues, parents, friends.<br>
          - <b>For producers</b> we planned to use the chat functionality of the OLX site, where a lot of local farmers can be 
          found.<br><br>
          After this generalized <b>customer segment</b> has been identified, by mining the interviews responses, we could get a 
          sense into the more granular customer segments.

                  <b>Consumer Discovery</b><br><br>
                Potential consumers were identified among friends, work colleagues, parents, parents' friends, by tailoring their 
                interests in buying quality goods at a proper price.
                The interviews were performed face to face by asking a number of 4 questions and the most relevant part of the response 
                was taken into consideration. Some of these interviews were also recorded to provide authenticity, while some of them 
                were held in a spontaneous manner when we met these persons, writing down their answers in a file.<br><br>

              <h3><span style="color: black; text-shadow: 0 0 8px #a8e6a1;">Consumers</span></h3><br>
              <b>What matters the most when buying goods?</b>
              It seems that the key factors in buying goods are a good price and the quality of the ingredients. This is the goal of 
              Agro as most quality products have a high price in the supermarket or marketplaces and by connecting the consumers with 
              the producers, we find a way to get a lower price for more quality.<br><br>
    
              <b>Where do you buy your natural goods, if you are buying bio goods?</b>
              Most of the people that buy bio goods reported that they usually buy from the marketplace or the supermarket, with a low 
              number reporting that they know a local producer. This yields an opportunity for Agro to fill the gap and attract more 
              customers to buy from local producers and know them better.<br><br>
    
              <b>How often did you buy bio goods in the last period?</b>
              Here the results are quite mixed between often and rarely, proving that there are factors which stop people from buying 
              bio goods more often, as seen in the other insights, probably the price.<br><br>
    
              <b>Did you encounter difficulties when buying bio goods? How did you mitigate?</b>
              Here the results are again mixed, with the people that encountered difficulties saying that they usually tried harder to 
              find them and searched specialized stores and local producers. Agro could become a source for people with these difficulties.<br><br>
    
              <b>Where do you want your goods to be delivered?</b>
              Most of the people said that they want a combination of visiting the farmer and receiving goods at home. This is what Agro 
              will be tailored to do.<br><br>
    
              <h3><span style="color: black; text-shadow: 0 0 8px #a8e6a1;">Producers:</span></h3><br>
              Producers usually sell through known people and the OLX platform (normal considering it is the platform we asked the questions 
              through).
              Agro needs to offer better services than OLX in order to attract these producers.<br>
    
              The biggest difficulty producers encountered is that they found people who were not really keeping their word, as there is no 
              optimized mechanism of processing the transactions and receiving the goods. Agro aims to solve that.<br>
    
              Most of them increase their number of clients through recommendations. Through Agro they will get greater visibility, as it 
              will foster a big number of clients.
              Regarding an application that might solver their problem, the producers underlined the need for it to be really simple. Only 
              in that case it would be useful, considering that farmers are usually older people.
              We need to keep in mind that as we are moving forward with the application.<br><br>

          Agro was <b>not significantly affected by these results</b> but there are some things that need to be kept in mind when developing the startup:<br><br>
          -	The <b>interface needs to be really simple</b>. No complex processes. This is crucial.<br>
          -	It <b>does not need to be a “money grab”</b>, providing good prices, also for the consumers and the producers as well.<br>
          -	<b>Sources need to be verified</b> and only quality products that went through ANPC standards approved to be listed on the platform.<br>
          -	A <b>good acquisition system</b> needs to be put in place. We will offer a connection between the consumers and producers, but that needs to be regulated.<br>
          -	There is a need to find a way to <b>promote the app's visibility</b> drastically as it will be dependent on a high user base in order to gain trust from both parties.
