                    <p class="home__description">Agro is an innovative startup that supports <b>Romanian farmers</b> in
                        <b>selling</b> their organic products directly to <b>urban consumers</b>. Through a map-based platform,
                        farmers, regardless of the size of their business, can <b>list their locations and products</b>, from
                        vegetables and fruits to meat or grains. Customers can purchase products <b>directly</b> from the
                        source, bypassing intermediaries, and can opt for <b>delivery services</b>. Agro thus offers a solution
                        to the issue of farmers selling at <b>low prices to supermarkets</b>, creating a direct connection
                        between producers and consumers and ensuring access to local, <b>high-quality products</b>.</p>

                    <h2 class="section__title-center">The problem <br> we solve</h2>
                    <p class="security__description">During the brainstorming session necessary to come up with an idea of a 
                        startup, all of us realised that, especially on the consumer side, there is a great demand of farmers 
                        products in the ranks of people living in the town without access to them.<br><br>
                        <b>Firstly</b>, consumers might say that they can get these products at the supermarket or the local farmer 
                        market, but these products usually come at a really high price and their origin cannot be validated, 
                        thus providing a psychological barrier to the consumer.<br>
                        <b>Cases where consumer interest has been validated</b>:<br>
                        -	<b>Workplace and Friends</b>: People usually have parents who are local farmers / producers and they sell 
                        their products to colleagues / friends. These products are: fruits, alcoholic beverages, olive oil. <br>
                        -	<b>People in our circle</b> complaining a lot that food does not have taste anymore, even though originating 
                        from the farmers market.<br><br>
                        <b>Secondly</b>, on the farmers side, there were some cases where producer interest was validated:<br>
                        - <b>Local producers</b> in the countryside having a great orchard, and producing more than they could ever eat, 
                        but not having a space to sell their harvest in order to maximize profits.<br>
                        - <b>Producers who do not have an open market</b> and are forced to sell their products to middle men in order 
                        to make some money.<br>
                        - <b>Farmers</b> who do not have enough visibility and think they will never be successful.<br><br>
                        Thus, by taking into account these memos obtained from real cases during our brainstorming we found the 
                        problem we want to solve.

                    <p class="services__description">As we have seen during the problem statement, <b>the problem is that there is no 
                        connection between these farmers trying to sell their products and the town people willing to buy the products</b>.
                        The Agro platform comes up with the solution and it is supposed to offer <b>a bridge between these two parties</b>.<br><br>
                        By offering a map-based UI, consumers can have access to local producers and their 
                        location on the map to pass by them and buy goods. The local farmers can also offer delivery options using 
                        Agro's special delivery trucks that keep the food fresh, but this would be the second stage as additional 
                        funding is required for this step.<br><br>
                        <b>For the providers</b>, Agro will offer <b>a platform where they can list announcements</b> regarding their products in 
                        order to get greater visibility, increase their store credibility by reviews, and foster a quality customer 
                        relationship.<br><br>
                        
                        <b>To Be Noted</b>: Producers will need to pass <b>ANPC's</b> standards to be on the platform. Guidance on how to pass these 
                        standards will be provided by the Agro customer support team. They will also need to be registered as a proper 
                        business in order to pass financial controls and help sustain Agro's trust level.

                        <b>Consumers</b>:<br>
                        -	People with no access to local farmers goods at a proper quality to price ration that wish 
                        to consume quality goods.<br>
                        -	People who want to support the farmers of Romania by buying directly from their business.<br>
                        -	People that want to make sure they are living a healthy lifestyle, by buying directly from 
                        the source and validating the origin of the products they are consuming.<br><br>
                        <b>Producers</b>:<br>
                        -	Local small farmers who produce an excess of goods with no place to get visibility and sell 
                        those products and a wish of making an additional income.<br>
                        -	Established small and big producers who want to increase their visibility and sell more.<br>
                        -	Small producers who do not have an open market where they can sell their products at the right 
                        price.<br><br>
                        We are aware that these customer segments need to be validated.
                        We came up with these customer segments in a brainstorming session where we analysed Agro's goal 
                        and possible impact on the market.<br><br>
                        <b>These customer segments</b> are also derived from the main two parties that are going to use this platform:<br>
                        -	People who want to buy local goods from farmers, thus getting quality products at a low price.<br>
                        -	People who want to sell their goods at a good price and get greater visibility.

                    <p class="app__description">After our research, we discovered that there are <b>some potential competitors</b>, 
                        most of them doing things a little bit different:<br><br>
                        -	<b>Freshful</b> – delivers products at home through an online marketplace. The customer is effectively buying 
                        from the Freshful platform who buys goods en gross, not directly from the local farmer.<br>
                        -	<b>OLX</b> – mimics the concept of Agro and it is the close to our business model, but as OLX is a general 
                        marketplace, it does not have the highest credibility among users who want to buy fresh local farmers goods. 
                        The products are also bought with cash and no financial or quality controls, things that Agro wishes to have 
                        as a professional platform.<br>
                        -	<b>Sezamo</b> – follows the same principle as Freshful.<br>
                        -	<b>Nod Verde</b> – has the same principle of Agro, but again it acts as an intermediary. It is also localized in 
                        Cluj and does not allow any farmers to join, just established producers with a booming business already.<br>
                        -	<b>PlatFerma</b> - The business with almost the same idea as Agro, but it is done unprofessionaly, it has a lot 
                        of dead-end links and it is not offering an online marketplace, just local farms locations and redirect links. 
                        They are focusing more on promoting the farmers to the public, rather than actually helping them sell their products.<br>
                        -	<b>Malltaranesc.ro</b> – Same idea as Agro. This will be our main competitor.<br><br>
                        <b>Competitor classification</b>:<br>
                        <b>Mall Taranesc</b> – Main competitor<br>
                        <b>PlatFerma</b> – Focuses only on promoting farmers.<br>
                        <b>Nod Verde</b> – Works only with established producers and is localized only in Cluj.<br>
                        <b>Sezamo, Freshful</b> – Acts as an intermediary, crushing the type of bridge between producers and consumers that Agro 
                        is trying to create.<br>
                        <b>OLX</b> – Generalized platform, not focused on local farmers, but rather an announcements platform.
