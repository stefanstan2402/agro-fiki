            <b>The main point of validation</b> that needs to be checked is whether a customer would buy a product on the platform or a farmer would post announcements.<br><br>
            In order to do this, the application needs to reach the hands of different users. The best candidates that were chosen for this validation are 
            part people that have helped with feedback during the business validation process and part people who have never seen the application in order 
            to get a fresh glimpse upon the logic.<br><br>
            We have held <b>6 different interviewing sessions</b> that were recorded and documented in order to get further improvement feedback and decide whether 
            they would be willing to use the application in a way that would generate revenue for the business.<br><br>

            <img src="assets/img/img1.png" alt="Large Image" style="display: block; margin: auto;"><br>

            These interviewing sessions consisted of people browsing the application with the presence of a team member who asked different questions in 
            order to get as many insights as possible.<br><br>
            At first the business ideas and goals were discussed, leaving the interviewed person to freely browse while the team member spoke about the functionalities.<br><br>
            At the end the individual would be asked if he would contribute financially to the project as a sponsor or would like to buy from the site. 
            Also <b>respecting the principles from "The Mom Test"</b>, the person was asked to remember situations where this application would have been useful 
            and imagine if this would solve his or her problems.<br><br>

            <p class="services__description" style="text-align:left;">
            “The physical marketplace system is rigged. This would be helpful, giving me opportunities.”<br><br>
            “I am too exhausted from my work. I would love to have an application like this in order not to go to a marketplace.”<br><br>
            “Having bio goods so close would improve my diet and ultimately my life all together.”<br><br>
            “Do you guys need help in developing this? I would be glad to take part in this as it would help a lot of people I know.”<br><br>

            <h1>The main insights that were extracted during these interviews</h1>
            <p class="services__description" style="text-align:left;">
            -   The application has a lot of room for growth, the design being rudimentary<br>
            -   People were enthusiastic about the idea, imagining what this business could become<br>
            -   Some flows were a little bit confusing<br>
            -   More features need to be developed in order to fit the customer needs<br>
            -   There wasn't a lot of trust given to the business, considering the MVP design, but the application solves most of the customer needs<br><br></p>
            <h1>Final conclusion</h1>
            <p class="services__description" style="text-align:left;">
              <b>People were enthusiastic about the idea</b>, and with a full product their trust can be won over, but at this stage we can consider the results to be
              mixed, due to the project being just an MVP.<br>
              Considering all of this there were people who were enthusiastic enough to want to buy, use this kind of application or even sponsor us.<br>
